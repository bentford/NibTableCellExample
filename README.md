## Load nib as UITableViewCell

This is a sample project to demonstrate how to load a `UITableViewCell` from a nib.

This used to be documented by Apple in the "Table View Programming Guide", but the method has been deprecated by StoryBoards.

It's still an acceptable way load cells and there is no reason why you can't use this technique.
